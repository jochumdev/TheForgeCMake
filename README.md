# The Forge CMake Files

This project contains all CMake files required to build The Forge and it's libraries out-of-tree.

It has been fully tested on Linux, Windows tests will follow any other platforms by the lack of them I can't test.

## Future plans

While this can serve as out-of-tree CMake builder I wish to have this included in The Forge.

## Inspiration

I started this as a fork of [JonaGoldsmith/The-Forge-CMake](https://github.com/JonahGoldsmith/The-Forge-CMake.git) you will still find pieces from him here, he forked
[VoidAnchor/TheForgeTheCmake](https://github.com/VoidAnchor/TheForgeTheCmake).

As I extended the above CMake project I started to switch everything to the same Layout as the "UbuntuCodeLite" project's inside TheForge have.
